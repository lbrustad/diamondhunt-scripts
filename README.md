# DH3 Superfix by Lassebrus

Welcome to DH3 Superfix, this is a module-based package with scripts written in TypeScript and transpiled down to JavaScript to be ran as userscripts with Tampermonkey for [Diamond Hunt 3](https://dh3.diamondhunt.co/)

So far, there is no features to share, but if you're a dev and want to develop features for DH3 too, you might need to know how the game is coded, and in the [game](./game) directory here, you'll be able to read it!
